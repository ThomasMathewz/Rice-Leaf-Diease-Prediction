# Rice-Leaf-Diease-Prediction
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify three types of rice leaf diseases from image data. The model is trained on a small dataset of 120 images, demonstrating how deep learning can be effectively applied even to limited datasets through data augmentation and transfer learning techniques.
